# IBM Data Science Portfolio  

## Overview  
Welcome to my IBM Data Science Portfolio! This repository showcases the projects I completed as part of the **IBM Professional Data Science Certificate** on Coursera. Each project highlights my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and visualisation.

All the code in this repository has been **individually written by me**, ensuring originality and demonstrating my ability to independently apply data science concepts to solve real-world problems.  

Through these projects, I aim to showcase my ability to derive actionable insights, solve complex problems, and effectively communicate results. 

[Please also check out my ML repository for more in-depth model building based on multiple awesome O'Reilly books]

Key languages used are:

1. Python
2. SQL (ipython-sql extension)
